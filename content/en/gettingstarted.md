Setting up an overseas branch in the Netherlands is no walk in the park. Like in any other place, there are various rules to follow. Most likely you plan to set up a limited liability company (‘B.V.’ in Dutch), a legal entity that is equivalent to the private limited company. Setting up a B.V. encompasses more than just registering the company at the local chamber of commerce (‘KvK’). You will have to draw up statutes, make a deposit at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, register your company at a notary’s office, and so on.
