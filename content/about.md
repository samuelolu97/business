Many Chinese companies dream about successfully expanding their business overseas, particularly in established markets such as Europe and the United States. However, statistics tell us that more than 50% of all new companies accessing the European market, fail. This is mainly because conquering overseas markets brings many challenges; challenges that your company will not have to deal with while operating domestically.

Developing business in Europe has many benefits: prestige, relatively low taxes, economic stability and an overall healthy business climate to expand your business. However, you shouldnâ€™t underestimate the challenges that you might face. Cross Border China (CBC) can help you to overcome these challenges and accompany you during your (first) steps in Europe, starting from the Netherlands.

CBC can help you with:
-	Workshops and getting the information you need;
-	Legal matters;
-	Communication (Mandarin Chinese, English, Dutch);
-	Overcome cultural challenges;
-	Establishing the right relationships with the right partners.
